#+title: Delete Latest Commit
#+author: Jaj Dollesin

To delete your latest commit locally so that you can pull changes first, you can use the following steps:

1. *Soft reset your latest commit* (this will remove the commit but keep your changes in the working directory):

   #+begin_src bash
   git reset --soft HEAD~1
   #+end_src

   This command undoes the last commit but leaves your changes staged. After this, you can pull the changes from the remote repository.

2. *Pull the latest changes* from the remote repository:

   #+begin_src bash
   git pull
   #+end_src

3. After pulling, you can now *recommit your changes*:

   #+begin_src bash
   git commit -m 'your commit message'
   #+end_src

4. Finally, you can *push the changes*:

   #+begin_src bash
   git push
   #+end_src

   This way, you don't lose your work, and you can successfully pull and push without conflicts.
